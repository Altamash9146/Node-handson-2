        response.write("<h3>Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment. It provides a minimalistic and flexible set of tools and features for building web applications and APIs.</h3>")
        response.write("<p>Express simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware management, and serving static files. It allows developers to create robust and scalable web applications using a straightforward and intuitive API.</p>")
        response.write("<p>Here are some key features of Express:</p>")
        response.write("<ol>")
        response.write("<li>Routing: Express provides a simple and efficient way to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URLs. Routes define how the server should respond to client requests.</li>")
        response.write("<li>Middleware: Express uses middleware functions to process requests before they reach the route handler. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as parsing request bodies, handling authentication, logging, and more. Express allows developers to create custom middleware or use existing middleware modules.</li>")
        response.write("<li>Templating: Express supports various template engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, which enable the creation of dynamic HTML pages on the server. Templating engines help generate HTML responses by merging data with predefined templates.</li>")
        response.write("<li>Error Handling: Express provides a built-in error handling mechanism to catch and handle errors that occur during request processing. This makes it easier to handle errors consistently across an application.</li>")
        response.write("<li>Static File Serving: Express can serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, directly from the file system. This feature simplifies the process of hosting static content.</li>")
        response.write("<li>Middleware and Routing Modularity: Express allows developers to organize their application into modular middleware and routing functions. This promotes code reusability and maintainability by separating concerns.</li>")
        response.write("</ol>")
        response.write("<p>Express is highly extensible, and developers can integrate it with various third-party modules to enhance functionality. It is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem and has a large and active community, which provides a rich ecosystem of middleware and plugins.</p>")
